I learnt quite a lot from this project even though I have coded in Go before. I've learnt how JWTs are generated, how to parse it, and how to get it to function properly as a middleware.

The most difficult part was trying to understand how jwt-go library works. The documentation is so limited, and there are not a lot of people who use this library as well. But once I started to get hold of it, everything became much more easy.
